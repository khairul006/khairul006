  <br>"I want to be the one that know all the thing. From frontend to the backend. From local to the cloud. From architecture to the security.<br> 
  But to be realistic, I dream to be a cybersecurity expert and of course you must know how the cyber works. <br>
  A big goal and here I am starting my journey with software development."<br>
